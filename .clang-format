# This repository contains a large amount of legacy code with mixed styles.
# The goal of this file is to provide a consistent baseline for *new or touched*
# code. Do NOT run clang-format over the whole repository in one go unless a
# dedicated "format-only" change is explicitly planned and reviewed.
