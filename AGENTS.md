# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

> Purpose: consistent, reliable Codex execution for complex tasks.

## Priorities
1. Correctness and safety over speed.
2. Clear scope and acceptance criteria before changes.
3. Automated verification whenever possible.
4. Small, reviewable commits and recoverable state.

## Commit policy
- 使用 Angular commit-log 格式：`type(scope): subject`。
- 按功能粒度拆分提交，避免把无关变更混在同一提交中。
- Issue CSV/TODO 的更新与对应功能改动放在同一提交内。

## E2E loop
E2E loop = plan → issues → implement → test → review → commit → regression.

## Plan & issue generation
- Use the `plan` skill for plan and Issue CSV generation.
- If the `plan` skill is not available in this session, write the plan/Issue CSV manually (still follow the same fields and rules).
- Plans must include: steps, tests, risks, and rollback/safety notes.

## Issue CSV guidelines
- Every row must include: ID, Title, Description, Acceptance, Test_Method, Tools, Dev_Status, Review1_Status, Regression_Status, Files, Dependencies, Notes.
- Status values are enumerated (TODO/DOING/DONE), never percentages.
- If a task lacks a test method, add one or flag it as a risk.
- One plan maps to one issue CSV unless explicitly split.
- Follow `issues/README.md` for column definitions and CSV formatting.

## Tooling and tests
- Prefer local tools first; use MCP only when needed.
- Run the narrowest test that proves the change, then expand if risk is high.
- Do not claim tests ran if they did not.

## Tool usage
- When a matching MCP tool exists, use it; do not guess or simulate results.
- Prefer the tool specified in the Issue CSV `Tools` column.
- If a tool is unavailable or fails, note it and proceed with the safest alternative.

## Testing policy
- Follow `docs/testing-policy.md` for verification requirements and defaults.

## MCP tools catalog
- Follow `docs/mcp-tools.md` for available MCP tool names and usage.

## Safety
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless asked to break it.
- Never expose secrets; redact if encountered.

## Output style
- Keep responses concise and structured.
- Provide file references with line numbers when editing.
- Always include risks and suggested next steps for non-trivial changes.
